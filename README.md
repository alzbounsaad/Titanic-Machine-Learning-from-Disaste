# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This repository represent different machine learning algorithms that used to to classify "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaste" dataset.

First of all we do some exploration and visualization of the dataset, this could found in []Features_Importance.ipynb 

Algorithms:

  1- Support vector machine [SVM](SVM.ipynb)
  
  2- Gaussian Naive Bayes [a relative link] (Gaussian Naive Bayes.ipynb)
  
  3- Logistic Regression [Logistic_Regression] (Logistic Regression.ipynb)
  
  4- Decision Tree [Decision_Tree] (Decision Tree.ipynb)
  
  5- Random Forest [Random_Forest] (Random Forest.ipynb)
  
  6- Gradient Boosting Classifier [Gradient_Boosting_Classifier] (Gradient Boosting.ipynb)
  
  7- Bagging Classifier [Bagging_Classifier] (Bagging.ipynb)
  
  8- AdaBoost Classifier [AdaBoost_Classifier] (AdaBoost.ipynb)
  
  9- Voting Classifier [Voting_Classifier] (Voting.ipynb)
