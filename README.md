# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaste
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This repository represent different machine learning algorithms that used to to classify "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaste" dataset.

First of all we do some exploration and visualization of the dataset, this could found in []Features_Importance.ipynb 

Algorithms:
  1- Support vector machine [SVM](SVM.ipynb)
  2- Gaussian Naive Bayes [Gaussian Naive Bayes] (Gaussian Naive Bayes.ipynb)
  3- Logistic Regression [Logistic Regression] (Logistic Regression.ipynb)
  4- Decision Tree [Decision Tree] (Decision Tree.ipynb)
  5- Random Forest [Random Forest] (Random Forest.ipynb)
  6- Gradient Boosting Classifier [Gradient Boosting Classifier] (Gradient Boosting.ipynb)
  7- Bagging Classifier [Bagging Classifier] (Bagging.ipynb)
  8- AdaBoost Classifier [AdaBoost Classifier] (AdaBoost.ipynb)
  9- Voting Classifier [Voting Classifier] (Voting.ipynb)
