# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaste
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This repository represent different machine learning algorithms that used to to classify "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaste" dataset.

First of all we do some exploration and visualization of the dataset, this could found in Features_Importance.ipynb
